Lab sessions are held every week and will be conducted by a team of TAs and Sherpas. Labs are designed to provide you with basic knowledge and assistance in using the development tools you need to practice the use of data structures.

###Lab Rules
  1. You are to attend that lab you are registered for. Attending earlier or later labs is not allowed without explicit permission from one of the TAs.</li>

###Lab Schedule
This schedule may be changed somewhat over the course of the semester. The lab notes as written currently are based on a previous iteration of the class, and may change somewhat. Consider them authoritative after the corresponding week of class.
