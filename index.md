### Academic Integrity

The utmost level of academic integrity is expected of all students.

Under no circumstances may you submit work done with or by someone else under your own name. However, general questions regarding the class are permissible. If you are unsure post on Piazza privately.

You must acknowledge by name anyone whom you consulted. You may not give nor receive assistance from anyone else during an exam or midterm. You may not give any hints or post any material that might be part of a solution publicly on Piazza. If your question necessarily includes such material, post privately.

If you are unsure about what is permissible and what is not, please ask.
